    Currently only emcee sampler has been included, later I will include in other
    commonly used algorithms, such as Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs, Hamiltonian,
    etc ..

    How about writing a paper on the design of the structure of imcmc?

Mar-19-2015 [not finished -- done]
    Add support for derived parameters.

Mar-27-2015 [not finished]
    Add convergence check/diagnosis.

Oct-10-2015 [not finished]
    Planned to add other algorithms, i.e., the traditional Metropolis-Hastings,
    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and an interface to MultiNest.

Oct-12-2015 [not finished]
    Write a document.

    add the option to restart the sampling from some place. also add the option 
    to adjust the number of CPUs in use, i.e., after testing (burning) using very
    few cores, one can immediately first stop the sampling and then change the
    settings in ini-file and re-run the job submission.

    void ensemble_workspace::restart(***);

    inside this function, the number of walkers should not be changed!!!

	implement additional check of sample points, those who have NOT move for MANY
    times.  These points are not expected, since they occurence might indicate
    some peculiar or even ridiculous properties of posterior distribution function
    in the neighborhood of that point.

	Prepare to upgrade parser, adding new structures to store readed key-value
    pairs, so all contents will be read in once for all.  When we need value(s)
    of some key, just query that from the struture(s).

Feb-27-2016 [not finished]
	Define new Likelihood class, add more features, for example, add summary of
    the likelihood object, including all parameter names, likelihood name, and 
    etc..  All the new information will be output to some txt file(s), so the
    user will see more details about the likelihood function(s) they have used.

	How about mixing different MCMC sampler/algrithom together into a unified
    MCMC interface?

Mar-20-2016 [not finished]
	Add support for output chisqs of each likelihood function(s).

Oct-10-2016 [NOT finished]
    update 'make check' to parallel-mode
